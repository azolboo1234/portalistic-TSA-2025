# TSA PROJECT INFO
TSA project for "Video Game Design". Anand Zolboo and Max Casebolt worked on this project. I did all of the art for the whole game, and concepting some parts of the game, while Max did like 99% of the coding (me doing a little bit here and there). We then used the offical turbowarp packager to turn our project into a HTML. We then used github to host the HTML. However, school systems might have blocked the website because some HTMLs from github are used to host games, which, well, if you put the pieces together. you will find that schools never really liked students playing games in class. Thus, some schools could have blocked the site.
