# portalistic-TSA-2025
TSA project for "Video Game Design". The project was made in open-source fork and modified version of Scratch 3, named "Turbowarp". Turbowarp was used due to it compiling Scratch's code into optimized Javascript, letting the project run significantly faster. It also has more custom blocks, and more features.
